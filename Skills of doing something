# The second chapter
1. Make full use of sleeping mind. 

When you are obsessed in some priblem, and don’t know how to solve it, you can write down the clues in a paper before going to sleep. Then the next morning you’ll find it becoming clearer than the day before.

So please think about the hardest question lying in bed before sleeping, instead of playing games or scanning boring content.
